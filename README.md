# putty2html
A quick tool to convert Putty logs in HTML while giving some colors to predefined keywords

## Version 1
Everything is hardcoded. I know, it's awfulC
 
```bash
python putty2html.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile>
```
- inputfile: a text file. Any extension will be fine
- outputfile: a basic **.html** file

## Perspectives
- Customizable list of keywords
- Ability to configure font options with a user-friendly trick/file/something (maybe XML/YAML ?)
- Is it possible to export the Putty output to a text file from command lines?
